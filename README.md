In the Project I have implemented the micro service backend for social media( few module). For the technolgy stack, I have used NodeJS, Express, Axios, NoSQL(MongoClient).

The project has 2 modules.

The database has 3 Collections.

Note: I am working with backend for last 2 years, and so I prefer to work as backend engineer. Though I am familier with Angluar, Currently I am not able to create the UI. Saying this I might need to polish my frontend skills, whenever I again start working on it. For the Frontend I am familier with HTML, CSS, Javascript/typescript and angular material design.
